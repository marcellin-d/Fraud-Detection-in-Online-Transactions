# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a given transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on various features of the transaction. The dataset used in this project includes anonymized features for privacy, such as the transaction amount, time, and other factors that may contribute to identifying fraudulent activities.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, machine learning models are applied to a real-world dataset of credit card transactions to detect fraud. The entire process follows a typical data science pipeline:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
2. **Data Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
3. **Handling Imbalanced Dataset** (SMOTE)
4. **Model Training** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. **Evaluation** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix)

At the end of the project, we obtain a trained model, performance evaluation metrics, and a detailed report summarizing the results.

## **Setup and Installation**

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CreditCardFraudDetection.git
cd CreditCardFraudDetection
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Dependencies**

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **imblearn** (for SMOTE)

To install all dependencies at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Running the Project**

To run the project and generate results, execute the `main.py` script. This script will handle the entire pipeline from data loading to model evaluation.

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will output the following:

1. Data loading confirmation, including the shape of the dataset.
2. Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and scaling the "Amount" column.
3. Model training results for Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
4. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## **Model Evaluation**

After running the model, review the detailed evaluation in the `evaluation_report.txt` file. The evaluation includes:

### Key Metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 94.34%  
- **Precision** for both classes (fraud and non-fraud)  
- **Recall** for both classes  
- **F1-Score** for a balanced measure of precision and recall  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### Example Output:

```

## **Handling Imbalanced Dataset with SMOTE**

One of the main challenges encountered in this project was the **imbalanced dataset**. The dataset contains far more non-fraudulent transactions (Class 0) than fraudulent transactions (Class 1). This imbalance can lead to biased models that predict the majority class more frequently, undermining the detection of fraud.

To address this issue, we employed **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) from the `imblearn` library. SMOTE generates synthetic samples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions) by interpolating between existing examples, thereby balancing the dataset and improving the model's ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions.

### SMOTE Code Example

Here is a code snippet demonstrating how SMOTE is applied to balance the dataset:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load your dataset
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)  # Features
y = data['Class']  # Target variable

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Now X_res and y_res are balanced and ready for model training
```

This technique helps ensure the model doesn't become biased toward predicting the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions), ultimately improving fraud detection performance.
